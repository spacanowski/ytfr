##Example

Friend found new Machine Heads album (Bloodstone & Diamonds - http://youtu.be/PJKReRPG5tM) before you (the nerve of bastard) and wants to send you one song, let's go with 'Sail Into The Black'.

Then he click generate link button and sends you generated link (http://youtu.be/PJKReRPG5tM?repStart=1477&repEnd=1986). You listenn to song, you thank your friend and you click rape ...uhm.... I mean repeat button and you listen and listen and listen
